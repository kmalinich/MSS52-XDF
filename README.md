# MSS52-XDF
TunerPro XDF for BMW MSS52 DME used with S62B50 engine. It is not complete; it is in the state I currently need it in, no more, no less. I created this while tuning my daily driver E39 M5. It's a constant work in progress. 

Developed by reading many, many, many forum posts, referencing tap/saildot4k XDFs, the (in)famous A2L, and hunting through MSS54/MSS54HP binaries.
